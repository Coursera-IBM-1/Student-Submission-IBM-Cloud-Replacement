Issue with IBM account

It looks like others may be having the same problems based on the pinned threads, 
but I cannot access either of the pinned threads (I get a message that they don't exist). 

My final submission link is going to an incomplete version of my notebook (about 1 hour before I completed the project). 
I also cannot get my assets to load in IBM's Cloud Pak for Data to check/modify my submission.

Hi

Apologies for the inconvenience!    

As an alternative, you can complete your assignment locally or in Skills Networks Lab i.e. the course environment.

Once you complete the assignment locally, Upload the assignment in GitHub repository. 
If you don't have account on GitHub you can follow the instructions given in the link how to create an account, 
how to create repository and how to upload it. 

https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0105EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module2/GitHub1_Getting_Started.md.html 

Once uploaded, you can share the GitHub repo link while submitting the assignment.    

Note: If you are doing in Skills Network lab, make sure to download the assignment you have done and then upload it in GitHub   

Happy learning!  

Regards,  

Niveditha
